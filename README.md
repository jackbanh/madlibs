# madlibs

Madlib Creator is a library for generating madlib sentences out of preexisting text corpuses.

This project was used as part of the **TV Helper** installation at *Art Hack Day: Deluge* at Pioneer Works, NYC in January 2015.

This library will take a collection of text files and create pseudo-mad lib files out of them.  It performs basic POS tagging on text files and selects sentences that fit a pre-defined set of rules, and tags them for noun replacement.

## Installation Instructions

    bundle install

## Usage Instructions

The library looks for subdirectories within the `texts` directory, each containing text files.  It will create a collection of text files within the `output` directory.

This command will execute the script:

    bundle exec ruby splitter.rb

For each subdirectory within `texts`, it will generate two output text files.  for example, the `texts/example` subdirectory will create a `output/example_1.txt` and an `output/example_2.txt`.

These text files consist of a list of sentences, one per-line. The number indicates the number of nouns in each sentence.  the nouns themselves have been replaced with `--NOUN--`, to facilitate automatic find-and-replace.
